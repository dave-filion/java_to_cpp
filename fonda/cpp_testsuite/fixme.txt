Bugs
-------------

cpp/

function_parenthesis.c - The problem is that the include is processed
after the buffer that contains the ")".

stringifications_strings.c - Lexer error.

macros/

exercise_context.c - Issue with function-like macro broken by
conditional.

function_if_weird_paren5.c, function_object3.c - Something is wrong
with the hoisted function-like macro expansion.  It yields an
infeasible branch "#elif 0".

pragma_once.c - #pragma once is not implemented.

token_pasting_conditional.c - The argument to the function that does
the token-pasting is a conditional.  The preprocessor should first
hoist this, and then invoke the function once for each branch.  Since
the argument to the function is used in a token-pasting, it should not
be expanded, but it is!

Strange Behavior
----------------

macros/

exercise_bdds.c - After (3) combine multiple streams, there are
extraneous conditionals at the end of the expansion.

exercise_expression_bdds.c - Preserve whitespace after directives.
Need to emit it separately from directive, which will require
reworking directive parsing and preprocessor.

fork_block2.c - Extraneous blocks at end of function-like macro
expansion.  Probably has to do with function-like macro hoisting.


Fine Details
------------

function_parenthesis.c - Need to test that #define in a zero-argument
function-like macro is being evaluated properly.  Furthermore, need to
test that defines and undefs in all arguments are being evaluated
properl, since they are only evalauted if expandArg is called.  It is
not called for stringified or token-pasted arguments.
